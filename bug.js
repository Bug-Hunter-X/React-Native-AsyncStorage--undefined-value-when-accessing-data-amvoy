This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved.  This typically happens when you attempt to read data from AsyncStorage immediately after calling getItem(). AsyncStorage operations are asynchronous, meaning they don't return the data instantly.  If you try to use the result of getItem() before the asynchronous operation completes, you'll likely get an undefined or null value.  The following code snippet demonstrates this problem. 

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const getData = async () => {
  const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey');
  // This will often be undefined or null because AsyncStorage.getItem is async
  console.log('Value:', value); // Incorrect usage
  // Use value here
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    getData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Incorrect: Using value before it's retrieved */}
      <Text>Value: {value}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};
```
