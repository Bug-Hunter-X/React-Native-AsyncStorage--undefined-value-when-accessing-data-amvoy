# React Native AsyncStorage: undefined value when accessing data

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native applications. The error arises from attempting to access stored data before the asynchronous retrieval process is complete.  This results in undefined or null values.

## Problem
The problem lies in the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage's getItem() method.  The method doesn't return the data immediately; it returns a Promise.  If you try to use the returned value before the Promise resolves, you'll encounter undefined or null values.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that you only access the AsyncStorage data after it has been retrieved successfully.  This is done using async/await or Promises.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application on a simulator or device.
4. Observe that the text displayed is undefined or null because the data is accessed before it has been retrieved from AsyncStorage.

## How to fix the bug
1. Review the bugSolution.js file to see how to use AsyncStorage correctly with async/await, ensuring the data is retrieved before use.

This example highlights the importance of understanding asynchronous operations when working with data storage in React Native.
